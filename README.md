# Actual Budget — Homelab Deployment

This project is a customized deployment of [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/), an open-source personal budgeting app, set up to run on a private homelab environment. No changes to the app’s core functionality were made; the main modification is a custom deployment pipeline tailored for smooth, automated installation and updates within my homelab infrastructure. This setup allows easy self-hosted use of Actual Budget with reliable, repeatable deployment. For more details about the deployment process, please see the `DEPLOYMENT.md` file.
